- Cognitive: Limited problem-solving and pretend play

Screening Tools Used:
- M-CHAT-R: Positive for several autism spectrum concerns
- ASQ-3: Below average in communication and social domains
- Denver Developmental Screening: Delays noted

Current Plan and Interventions:

Immediate Actions:
1. Early intervention referral (completed)
2. Developmental pediatrician consultation (scheduled)
3. Comprehensive autism spectrum evaluation
4. Physical therapy evaluation for walking delay
5. Speech therapy evaluation

Follow-up Schedule:
- 2 weeks: Early intervention assessment
- 1 month: Developmental pediatrician
- 6 weeks: Follow-up with primary care
- Ongoing: Specialist recommendations

Parent Education and Support:
- Information about developmental delays
- Early intervention services explanation
- Home activities to encourage development
- Support group resources
- Importance of early intervention

Safety Considerations:
- Continue childproofing as mobility develops
- Consider gait training equipment if recommended
- Monitor for self-injurious behaviors

Provider Notes:
Zoe presents with multiple developmental delays that warrant comprehensive evaluation. While some children develop at different paces, the combination of gross motor, language, and social delays requires immediate attention. Early intervention services are crucial. Parents are receptive and committed to supporting Zoe's development.

The delays could represent:
- Global developmental delay
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Specific language disorder
- Motor planning difficulties
- Other neurodevelopmental conditions

Comprehensive evaluation will help determine the best intervention approach.
