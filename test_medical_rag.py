RAG Medical Chatbot Test with Ollama + DeepSeek-R1

This script tests the complete RAG pipeline with the medical documents
and Ollama integration. It demonstrates the improved medical reasoning
capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 over the previous FLAN-T5 model.

Usage:
    python test_medical_rag.py

Prerequisites:
    1. Ollama running with DeepSeek-R1 model
    2. Medical documents in data/documents/
    3. All dependencies installed
