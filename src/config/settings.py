Configuration settings for the chatbot application

This module defines all configuration settings used throughout the RAG chatbot application.
It uses Pydantic for settings validation and environment variable management.

Key Features:
- Environment variable support via .env files
- Type validation using Pydantic
- Automatic directory creation for data storage
- Centralized configuration management

Settings Categories:
- Model Configuration: LLM and embedding model settings
- API Keys: Integration with external services
- Gradio UI: Web interface configuration
- Document Processing: RAG pipeline parameters
- System: Device and debug settings

    Application settings with validation
    
    This class defines all configuration parameters for the RAG chatbot.
    Settings can be overridden via environment variables or .env file.
    
    How it works:
    1. Default values are provided for all settings
    2. Environment variables override defaults if present
    3. Pydantic validates types and constraints
    4. Settings are accessible globally via the settings instance
